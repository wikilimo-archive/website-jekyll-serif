## Pest Identification & Spread Prediction

In remote areas, detecting pests and diseases early is both a challenge and also a necessity. Early detection is challenging with limited resources but is crucial because remote areas have logistical limitations with regard to accessing remedies. Predictive insights are thus very useful. This necessitates both a locally accurate identification system as well as spread prediction to allow for use of sustainable bio-remedies.

Weather conditions are wonderful predictors for pest activity & outbreak. Machine Learning allows instant detection of crop pests & diseases.

Weather observation driven Pest Prediction and smartphone based Pest Identification allow farmers to apply timely biological control for protecting the crops from pests & diseases, bypassing the use of harmful pesticides that kill marine life.
